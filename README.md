## Installation

### MacOS

To install on Mac we currently require you to add an exception to GateKeeper to allow Etterna to run.

Any code that isn't code signed, will be detected as "bad" and thus not be allowed to run, you can add an exception to this
system for Etterna as follows.

```bash
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ~/your/path/to/Etterna
```

You path to Etterna is where ever you placed the folder inside of the DMG. If you copied it to your Desktop for example and renamed the folder, your path would be ``~/Desktop/Etterna``

If you're curious why we aren't code signed, simply we are an open source project with no means of funding and certificates cost money - hopefully one day we can afford a certificate, or a system such as let's encrypt provides a means to do it for free. 

### From Packages

For those that do not wish to compile the game on their own and use a binary right away, be aware of the following issues:

- Windows users are expected to have installed the [Microsoft Visual C++ x86 Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145) prior to running the game. For those on a 64-bit operating system, grab the x64 redistributable as well. [DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109) is also required. Windows 7 is the minimum supported version.
- macOS users need to have macOS 10.6.8 or higher to run Etterna.
- Linux users should receive all they need from the package manager of their choice.

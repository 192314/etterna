### C++

If you have *any* experience with C++ (Or even C and wanna learn a bit of c++) your help would be much apprecciated!
There's a lot of things that need doing. If you dont have any specific thing you want to work on here are some ideas:
 - Github Issues (https://github.com/etternagame/etterna/issues)
 - Coverity Defects (https://scan.coverity.com/projects/etternagame-etterna) (Currently these are private, you can request access with an email, we might make this public in the future)
 - Cleaning up the codebase in general (There's a lot of things that would be nice to see done, like replacing usage of RString with std::string)
 - If you know how to use them and see a good place for them, some usage of modern C++ features like smart pointers might be good to see in the project :)
 
### Lua

Lua is a fairly simple language. If you have experience in any other programming language, you'll probably be able to get the basics of its syntax in under an hour. https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html is probably a good place to learn a bit.

Lua is used in etterna for Themes and Noteskins. 

Noteskins control the way the notes are drawed (Most noteskins have very similar logic and only different images, but noteskins have the power to do a lot more, and some take advantage of that).

You can think of themes as the front end of the game. The way each screen is drawn, how screen branching (Changing) happens, and other things are controlled by the theme. A theme can even create new screens from scratch, catch inputs (Both mouse and keyboard), and other things. They're fairly powerful.

Currently, there's a lack of alternative themes (To the default one, Til Death) for Etterna. Spawncamping Wallhack (https://github.com/ca25nada/spawncamping-wallhack) is the only complete theme that supports Etterna as far as i know.
